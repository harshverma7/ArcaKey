# ArcaKey - Minimal Crypto Wallet Generator

Hey there! üëã This is ArcaKey, a simple crypto wallet generator I built for Solana and Ethereum. I wanted something clean and minimal without all the bloat of existing wallet tools.

## What it does

- Generate wallets for **Solana** and **Ethereum** from seed phrases
- Works completely offline (no sketchy server calls)
- Dark/light theme because why not
- Nice particle background effect that I spent way too much time on
- HD wallet derivation following BIP39/BIP44 standards
- Copy addresses and private keys with one click

## Solana Wallet Adapter Integration

ArcaKey includes seamless integration with Solana's Wallet Adapter, providing:

- **Multiple Wallet Support**: Connect with popular Solana wallets like Phantom, Solflare, and Slope
- **Transaction Signing**: Securely sign and send transactions using your connected wallet
- **Network Switching**: Easily switch between Solana networks (mainnet, testnet, devnet)
- **Balance Checking**: View your SOL and SPL token balances in real-time
- **Transaction History**: Access your recent transaction history
- **Wallet Management**: Add, remove, and manage multiple wallet connections

The Wallet Adapter integration makes it easy to interact with Solana dApps and manage your assets directly from ArcaKey.

## Why I built this

I was tired of complex wallet interfaces and wanted something simple for development and testing. Plus, I wanted to learn more about crypto wallet generation and thought building one would be fun.

## Tech stack

Built with modern web tech:

- React 19 + Vite 6 (because fast is good)
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Manrope font (looks clean)
- Solana web3.js and ethers.js for the blockchain stuff
- Some particle animation library that makes it look cool

## Recent Refactor & Design System

This project was recently refactored for improved modularity, maintainability, and consistent theming. UI patterns are now unified through a reusable component system and centralized style logic. All repeated UI elements (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.) are implemented as common components, making it easy to extend and maintain.

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone it
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd web-based-wallet

# Install stuff
npm install

# Run it
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` and you're good to go.

## How to use

1. Pick your blockchain (Solana or Ethereum)
2. Either paste an existing seed phrase or let it generate one
3. Click "Generate Wallet" and boom - you've got addresses
4. Create multiple wallets from the same seed if you want
5. Copy addresses or private keys as needed

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist` folder will have everything you need. You can throw it on any static host like Vercel, Netlify, or even GitHub Pages.

```

- **Design System:** All UI elements use a unified design system for consistent look and feel.
- **Centralized Styles:** Theming and style logic are managed in a single place for easy updates.
- **Modular Components:** Common UI and step logic are broken into small, reusable files.

## Security notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This generates real private keys and addresses. I built this for development/testing, so please be careful:

- Everything runs in your browser (no data leaves your device)
- Private keys are never sent anywhere
- Still, don't use this for mainnet funds without proper testing
- Always backup your seed phrases properly
- I'm not responsible if you lose money (seriously)

## Browser support

Works on modern browsers. If you're using Internet Explorer... please don't.
